# Kaktus-Code

**Kaktus-Code** is a custom programming language designed to offer a unique syntax and functionality. This project includes a compiler for Kaktus-Code, developed in **C#**, and features a cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Avalonia**. The project is open-source and released under the **MIT License**.

## Features

* **Kaktus-Code Language**: A unique programming language with its own syntax and features.
* **Custom Compiler**: A fully functioning compiler that translates Kaktus-Code into executable code.
* **Avalonia GUI**: A cross-platform graphical interface for a user-friendly experience.
* **Error Checking**: Includes detailed error messages and debugging tools.
* **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Technologies Used

* **C#**: The primary language used for developing the compiler and language processing components.
* **Avalonia**: Used for creating the cross-platform GUI for easier interaction with the compiler.
* **.NET**: The framework enabling cross-platform support and seamless development.

## Kaktus-Code Language

Kaktus-Code is designed with a focus on making own windows and styling. The language syntax is simple yet powerful, enabling both beginner and advanced users to write efficient and creative programs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 8.0 or higher)
* [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) for building the graphical interface.
